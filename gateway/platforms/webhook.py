"""Generic webhook platform adapter.

Runs an aiohttp HTTP server that receives webhook POSTs from external
services (GitHub, GitLab, JIRA, Stripe, etc.), validates HMAC signatures,
transforms payloads into agent prompts, and routes responses back to the
source or to another configured platform.

Configuration lives in config.yaml under platforms.webhook.extra.routes.
Each route defines:
  - events: which event types to accept (header-based filtering)
  - secret: HMAC secret for signature validation (REQUIRED)
  - prompt: template string formatted with the webhook payload
  - skills: optional list of skills to load for the agent
  - deliver: where to send the response (github_comment, telegram, etc.)
  - deliver_extra: additional delivery config (repo, pr_number, chat_id)
  - deliver_only: if true, skip the agent — the rendered prompt IS the
    message that gets delivered.  Use for external push notifications
    (Supabase, monitoring alerts, inter-agent pings) where zero LLM cost
    and sub-second delivery matter more than agent reasoning.

Security:
  - HMAC secret is required per route (validated at startup)
  - Rate limiting per route (fixed-window, configurable)
  - Idempotency cache prevents duplicate agent runs on webhook retries
  - Body size limits checked before reading payload
  - Generic HMAC supports a V2 signature (X-Webhook-Signature-V2) that
    binds a timestamp into the signed data for replay protection; the
    legacy body-only V1 (X-Webhook-Signature) is deprecated but still
    accepted with a warning, since it has no replay protection
  - Set secret to "INSECURE_NO_AUTH" to skip validation (testing only)

    """Whether an agent response means "deliberately say nothing".

    Webhook routes are autonomous background lanes: a subscription prompt tells
    the agent to answer with ``[SILENT]`` when a tick produced nothing worth a
    human's attention (a duplicate inbound, a stand-down because a sibling lane
    already replied, a routine close).  Nobody is waiting on the other end, so
    there is no reader for whom a "nothing happened" message is useful.

    The reason this is the loose autonomous rule rather than the live gateway's
    is what the two lanes optimise for.  In an interactive chat, swallowing a
    real answer because it happens to open with a marker is much worse than
    showing a stray marker, so ``is_intentional_silence_response`` demands the
    response be EXACTLY a marker.  A webhook run has the opposite payoff: the
    cost of a leaked non-story is a pointless notification on every tick, and
    models reliably add a sentence explaining why they stayed quiet — which
    under the strict rule flips the whole thing back to "deliver".  That is not
    a hypothetical: it is why a Helper support lane kept messaging its owner to
    report that it had nothing to report.

    So use the shared autonomous-lane matcher (also used by cron), which treats
    a marker on its own first or last line as silence while still delivering
    prose that merely mentions one mid-sentence.  Sharing the function keeps
    the two autonomous lanes from drifting apart, and keeps the interactive
    path untouched.

# Default bind host. ``None`` tells aiohttp/asyncio's ``create_server`` to bind
# BOTH address families (IPv4 + IPv6) — the portable dual-stack default.
#
# Why not "0.0.0.0" (the old default) or "::"?
#   - "0.0.0.0" binds IPv4 ONLY. On IPv6-only private networks — notably Fly.io
#     6PN, where an agent's ``<app>.internal`` name resolves to an ``fdaa:…``
#     IPv6 address — an IPv4-only listener is unreachable. That is exactly why
#     hosted-agent webhook routes were publicly unreachable: the edge router
#     reverse-proxies to ``<app>.internal:8644`` over 6PN (IPv6) but the adapter
#     was listening on 0.0.0.0 (v4 only) → connection refused.
#   - "::" is NOT a safe fix: on hosts where the kernel sets IPV6_V6ONLY=1
#     (verified on Fly machines), binding "::" yields an IPv6-ONLY socket, which
#     then breaks the IPv4 loopback health check (``curl 127.0.0.1:8644/health``)
#     and the AF_INET port-conflict probe in connect().
#   - ``None`` asks the event loop to create a listening socket per resolved
#     family, so both 127.0.0.1 (v4) and the 6PN fdaa (v6) are served regardless
